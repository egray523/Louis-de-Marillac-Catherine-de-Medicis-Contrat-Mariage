# IIIF Exercise 

This repo is a test to use Glen Robson's [IIIF Workbench Method](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/day-two/image-servers/level0-workbench.html) for IIIF level 0 images, using some images from my own research. The images are of Louis de Marillac and Catherine de MÃ©dicis's wedding contract, signed on 20 December 1607.
